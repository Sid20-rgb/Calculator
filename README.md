##Introduction 
  A simple Calculator performs the arthematic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, divison on numbers with
input through keyboard and output as digital display that makes easy for anyone without more knowledge to the calculate 
the numbers. The calculation in calculator is so efficient that it barely makes a mistake.

##Features
  Some of the features of my created calculator is listed below:
- It offers basic operations and evaluates commands immediately as they are entered.
- It performs the basic arthematic operations like addition by clicking on the "+" button on the keyboard.
- Subtraction by clicking on the "-" button on the keyboard. 
- Multiplication by clicking on the "X" button on the keyboard.
- Division by clicking on the "รท" button on the keyboard.

##Conclusion
  As this calculator has really limited features I'm willing to upgrade it with new features like calculation of remainder, powers, roots,
  trigonometric operations, etc. in future, other than that its a perfect and fine calculator for the basic and simple calculation.
